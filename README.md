# War-card-game-

A simple version of the card game War made with Python using Object Oriented Programming

"War" is a simple card game that is typically played by two players. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards in the deck.Here's how the game is played:

1.Shuffle the deck of cards and deal the entire deck evenly to both players, so that each player has the same number of cards.
2.Players simultaneously reveal the top card of their deck and place it face up on the table.
3.The player with the highest-ranked card wins both of the cards that were played and places them at the bottom of their deck.
4.If both players reveal cards of the same rank, then a "war" is declared and each player must place two additional cards face down on the table and then reveal a fourth card. The player with the highest-ranked fourth card wins all of the cards that have been played during the war.
5.The game continues until one player has won all of the cards in the deck.
